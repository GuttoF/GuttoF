# Hi!

<div style="text-align: justify;">  I've been studying Data Science since 2020, always developing projects as a way of learning. All my work is focused on solving business problems using concepts and tools of Data Science. I have already developed solutions in sales forecast and client churn prediction.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Sales Forecast](https://github.com/GuttoF/Rossmann-Store-Sales)
My strategy to solve this challenge was test machine learning models to forecast sales for the next 6 weeks and decide which will bring the best result for the company. After the modelling, the delivered solution was a telegram bot that receives the store number and returns the forescast for the next weeks.
